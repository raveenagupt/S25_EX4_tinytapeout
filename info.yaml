# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        Linear Regression Calculator      # Project title
  description:  Produces the "y = mx + b" of a 3x2 matrix (x,y).     # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: The user enters the X and Y values on a keypad PMOD (In total, 6 single digit values) and the OLED displays the linear regression model. 
  how_to_test:  Needs to be more than 6.25 MHZ
  external_hw:  Need to attach keypad PMOD and corresponding OLED PMOD to the input/output pins.    # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog"
